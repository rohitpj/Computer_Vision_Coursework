For tasks C1-C3 you are free to structure your code as you wish, however make sure
that all paths are relative and that your code runs without external dependencies.

For these tasks the interface to test your code is defined in the `main.py` file. 
Specifically, these functions:

- `test_task_c1`
- `test_task_c2`
- `test_task_c3`

will be called to test your code. Each function has detailed comments about the expected
input and output.
